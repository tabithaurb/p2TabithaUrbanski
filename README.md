## First Example 
### Pros
Simple design 
### Cons
The bottom right has a toggle menu that makes it a little complex to adjust while driving
### This is good or bad because 
This is easy to understand and the font is of a good size, which makes it easy to glance at and understand while driving. However there is more room for the individual display features so you can see the status of the vehicle easier while driving.

## Second Example 

### Pros 
The design is simplex and very compact 
### Cons
May be difficult to read if you are driving or if you don't have great upclose vision, it could be too small to undesrstand, and the numbers on the speedometer are too close together.
### This is good or bad because 
This is a good design for people who like something simple or who may get distracted more easily while driving

## Third Example 

### Pros
The lights draw attention perfectly to what is necessary, which is good for driving at night and not getting distracted, very detailed picture with the car and wheels
### Cons
The deatiled picture of the car and wheel pressures may be a con if you are used to a move simple design, this may be overwhelming or make it difficult to find other settings. It could also be distracting while driving. 
### This is good or bad because 
This is a bad design because it is very overwhelming, crowded, and would take a while to get used to

## Fourth Example 

### Pros
Its visually appealing and the spacing on the speedometer is great
### Cons
It can be a little overwhelming of a design becuase the image of the car like that can be distracting and unnecessary
### This is good or bad because 
This is a bad design because it is unnecessary to have the car on the road like that, the image is too detailed and can be distracting and the tachometer is on the opposite side

## Fifth Example 

### Pros 
Compact design

### Cons
Most people dont drive much above 60 and the range to 60 is very small, so most of the speedometer is consumed by speeds you will never hit

### This is good or bad because 
This is bad because it is not very easy on the eyes and the spacing isnt great





## List your most common features and other more rare uses of a car dashboards.
Checking my speed, checking the gas tank, and checking tire pressure, check engine light, check if the trunk or doors are open , check mileage

### More rare uses
Checking the temperature outside, and the rpm's (I never look at these), or check music


## List the controls that the user interacts with the car dashboards.
Turn signals, windsheild wipers, the gear shifter, and the door and trunk opening 


## What are some common mistakes you can make with this current designs?
With this current design it might be confusing to understand what the symbols mean, you may have to look them up. Also, the service inspection is confusing because I'm not sure what that does or is for at all 

## Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution and justify your design decisions.
I would put the warning lights all in the same area, instead of spread out everywhere. I would also add 0 mph to the speedometer, remove the service inspection and put the park symbol in the middle.
