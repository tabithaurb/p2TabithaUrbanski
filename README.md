### Pros
Simple design 
### Cons
The bottom right has a toggle menu that makes it a little complex to adjust while driving

## This is good or bad because 
This is easy to understand and the font is of a good size, which makes it easy to glance at and understand while driving however there is more room for display features so you can see more information about the status of the vehicle at one time.

### Pros 
Compact design

### Cons
Has the rpms before the speed and that can be a little confusing, also most people dont drive much above 60 and the range to 60 is very small, so most of the speedometer is consumed by speeds you will never hit

### This is good or bad because 
This is bad because it is not very easy on the eyes, and the order is confusing
